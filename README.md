# ml_exercitation

A repository containing projects and notes used to test ML algorithms for didactic purposes, taken from other repositories, courses and studied, annotated and noted by me. This repository is a sotrage for my own notes to help me keep track of the different concepts I studied during the course of the years and to give an idea of the topic I covered.  

Different directories are present here (and hopefully will be present in the future), dealing with different experiments and ML tutorials I undertook during the years to better learn the tricks of the trade.

- **Salary Prediction**: a simple project, consisting on one jupyter notebook, performing regression on a database consisting on data about employees with the aim to predict their salaries.

- **Basic Deep Learning Application Deployment** An example on how to deploy on a webserver a "simple" deep learning algorithm to use for image classification. The code shows how to build up a simple FastAPI server with an endpoint where it is possible to send images for image classification. 

- **A Journey Through Data** An example of what may happen when you deal with small databases when training a Convolutional Neural Network.
